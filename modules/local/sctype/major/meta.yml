With the comprehensive details from the Quarto notebook for the `SCYTPE_MAJOR_ANNOTATION` module, hereâ€™s the revised YAML documentation that captures the specifics of the module's operations:

name: sctype_major_annotation
description: This module performs major cell type annotations by integrating external marker databases with a given Seurat object. It involves differential expression analysis to identify top markers, annotates major cell types, and provides visualization through UMAP plots, dendrograms, and violin plots to display the annotated cell types and their distribution.
keywords:
  - single-cell
